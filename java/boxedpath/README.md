### Project Summary: Java Implementation of Secure File Path Handling

#### **The Need**
Modern Java applications often require file system access. However, unrestricted file access poses significant security risks, such as:
- Path traversal attacks allowing access to sensitive files.
- Accidental or malicious modifications to files outside the intended scope.

To mitigate these issues, there is a need for a robust mechanism to constrain file system operations within a defined directory or "sandbox."

---

#### **The Solution**
The **Java implementation** of `BoxedPath` and `SandboxPath` provides a secure and controlled environment for file system operations. By leveraging custom `Path`, `FileSystem`, and `FileSystemProvider` classes, this solution enforces sandbox constraints to prevent unauthorized file access.

---

#### **Key Components**
1. **`BoxedPath`**:
   - Represents a path constrained within a sandbox.
   - Validates that all operations (e.g., `resolve`, `normalize`) remain within the sandbox.
   - Overrides common `Path` methods to enforce security checks.

2. **`SandboxPath`**:
   - Acts as a root for the sandbox environment.
   - Simplifies initialization by wrapping the `BoxedFileSystem`.

3. **`BoxedFileSystem`**:
   - Extends `FileSystem` and ties operations to a specific sandbox directory.
   - Enforces sandbox constraints during path resolution and other file system operations.

4. **`BoxedFileSystemProvider`**:
   - A custom implementation of `FileSystemProvider` to manage and validate sandboxed file systems.
   - Handles low-level file operations (e.g., `newByteChannel`, `delete`) securely.

---

#### **Sample Code**

**Initialization and Basic Operations**
```java
import org.owasp.untrust.boxedpath.SandboxPath;
import org.owasp.untrust.boxedpath.BoxedPath;

import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BoxedPathExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Define the sandbox root
            SandboxPath sandbox = SandboxPath.boxroot("/secure/sandbox");

            // Create a path within the sandbox
            BoxedPath filePath = sandbox.of("example.txt");

            // Check if the file exists
            if (filePath.toFile().exists()) {
                System.out.println("File exists: " + filePath);
            } else {
                System.out.println("File does not exist: " + filePath);
            }

            // Attempt to resolve a path outside the sandbox
            try {
                BoxedPath invalidPath = sandbox.of("../outside.txt");
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                System.out.println("Security Error: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

#### **How It Works**
1. **Sandbox Creation**:
   - A `SandboxPath` instance defines the root directory for constrained operations.
   - This instance ensures that all derived paths remain within the root directory.

2. **Path Validation**:
   - The `BoxedPath` class checks if paths are within the sandbox during creation or resolution. Any attempt to escape the sandbox results in a `SecurityException`.

3. **File System Operations**:
   - Common operations like `delete`, `move`, and `copy` are overridden in `BoxedFileSystemProvider` to ensure security constraints.

4. **Path Manipulation**:
   - Methods such as `resolve`, `normalize`, and `relativize` are securely implemented in `BoxedPath`.

---

#### **Benefits**
- **Enhanced Security**: Prevents unauthorized access or modification to files outside the sandbox.
- **API Familiarity**: Retains the API style of Java's `Path` and `FileSystem`, easing migration.
- **Robust Design**: Enforces constraints at multiple levels (e.g., path manipulation, file system operations).

#### **Migration from `Path` to `BoxedPath`**
To migrate existing code using Java's `Path` to the secure `BoxedPath`:
1. **Initialize a Sandbox**:
   Replace the root directory with a `SandboxPath` instance.
   ```java
   SandboxPath sandbox = SandboxPath.boxroot("/secure/sandbox");
   ```

2. **Use `BoxedPath`**:
   Replace `Path` operations with `BoxedPath` equivalents.
   **Before**:
   ```java
   Path path = Path.of("/secure/sandbox/example.txt");

   Path basePath = Path.of("./sandbox2");
   Path relativePath = basePath.resolve("subdir/example.txt");
   ```
   **After**:
   ```java
   BoxedPath path = sandbox.of("/secure/sandbox/example.txt");

   SandboxPath sandbox2 = SandboxPath.boxroot("./sandbox2");
   BoxedPath basePath = sandbox2.of("./sandbox2");
   BoxedPath relativePath = basePath.resolve("subdir/example.txt");
   ```

3. **Handle Exceptions**:
   Ensure any security violations (e.g., path escaping) are caught and handled.
   ```java
    import org.owasp.untrust.boxedpath.SandboxPath;
    import org.owasp.untrust.boxedpath.BoxedPath;

    import java.io.IOException;

    public class BoxedPathExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                // Initialize a secure sandbox
                SandboxPath sandbox = SandboxPath.boxroot("/secure/sandbox");

                // Create a secure path within the sandbox
                BoxedPath filePath = sandbox.of("example.txt");

                // Perform operations
                if (filePath.toFile().exists()) {
                    System.out.println("File exists: " + filePath);
                } else {
                    System.out.println("File does not exist: " + filePath);
                }

                // Attempt to create a path outside the sandbox
                try {
                    BoxedPath invalidPath = sandbox.of("../outside.txt");
                } catch (SecurityException e) {
                    System.out.println("Security Error: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

This solution is ideal for Java applications requiring strict file system access control, such as those handling untrusted code, user-uploaded files, or sensitive data.
